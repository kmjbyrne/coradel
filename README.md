# Under Construction

# Jenesis JS
Like Genesis, but with a J! 

Jenesis for JavaScript and CSS. Genesis generally implies the origin of something, most commonly the earth. Well that's what this project started as. The basic foundation to support Flask/Jinja frontends, in simple cases where larger frameworks were too bloated and more difficult to work with than simply writing ground up, vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

Built using BEM stylesheet syntax guidelines for easy yet structured and ergonomic component classes in templates and ES6 JavaScript.
